sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: It took more time than all of the others to sort the numbers, bubble sort is slow because 
it moves the higher values to the right and lower values to the left, so it takes a lot of time to solve all.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: It took less time than all of the other two, merge sort is faster because it sort smaller 
values, sort them and merge them back together in sorted order.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: It's not slow but not fast, selection sort finds the smallest unsorted value and add it to
the end, and keeps doing it until it's all sorted.
